                            Born and raised in the suburbs of Columbus, OH, Stockon is a midwestern kid 
                            through and through.
                            He is a Computer Science Major at BYU, which technically makes him a nerd.
                            But he likes to do cool things too, like make music. He has produced two albums,
                            which are available on Apple Music and Spotify.

                            Stockton is the pioneer of Taco
                            Tuesday and is glad to share his home every week with friends and strangers
                            alike to celebrate their God-given right to eat tacos.
