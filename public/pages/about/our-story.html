        Cousins John and Stockton established Don Juan Stockín's in the fall
        semester of 2019, with a vision to feed the poor college students 
        of Liberty Square.

        It all started with a simple desire to have good company over at 
        their apartment and enjoy great food. Since then, it has grown to be
        so much more.

        Taco Tuesday has become an opportunity for them and for those that come to 
        pause during the busy school week and forget life's troubles, even if
        just momentarily. The weekly event has become a local favorite for many
        residents at Liberty Square in Provo, Utah.

        Don Juan Stocktín's is Utah's leading non-profit taco joint, where each visitor
        splits the cost of the food and beverages prepared, which normally comes 
        out to less than $3.00 a person, leaving plenty of food for everyone.
